# rockpaperscissors

Have only been programming for a month or so now, so please go easy :)

This is my first rock paper scissors game using a function that controls the game.
I'm sure this isn't the most efficient way to set it up so I'm curious what others input would be.

I was also wondering how I would implement an option that counts how many wins each player has and breaks 
the loop at best 3 out of 5 or 5 out of 7, ect.
